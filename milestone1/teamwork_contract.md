# Team Contract

This team contract outlines the collective agreement among speech-santinizers about our operational guidelines. It includes a set of conventions and rules that we plan to follow.

## Team Goals

Our goals align with the overall project objective and the milestones:

- Work collaboratively to build a detoxification system that takes toxic comments as an input and produce detoxified (neutral) versions of the comments as output.
- **Milestone 1 (first week):** Agree on a team contract; topic selection; review papers related to the task; setup a plan for the baseline model; write a progress report.
- **Milestone 2 (second week + quiz week):** Develop a baseline model, build an evaluation pipeline; write a progress report, including details of the baseline model, implementation, W&B logs, and contributions.
- **Milestone 3 (third week):** Enhance Model Performance and Integrate Advanced Features; conduct thorough evaluation of the model using diverse datasets. (pending)
- **Milestone 4 (fourth week):** Implement strategies to optimize the multilingual detoxification models; fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve the performance across different languages. (pending)
- **Milestone 5 (fifth week):** Set up manual evaluation process; fine-tune model hyperparameters. (pending)
- **Milestone 6 (sixth week):** Write comprehensive documentation of the entire process; compile a paper; presentation; submit the model. (pending)

## Working Hours

- Embrace a flexible working schedule and adopt a casual working style. Each member should make a great effort to achieve the weekly goals.
- Communicate any exceptions that could lead to not meeting the weekly goals as early as possible.

## Meetings and Communication Plan

- Conduct at least one in-person weekly meeting before or during labs.
- Implement an informal meeting agenda for each gathering.
- Track and share important meeting notes and findings in the group chat.
- Utilize online meeting/collaboration tools (zoom/overleaf) for effective collaboration.
- Discuss work distribution based on individual strengths and interests during the weekly meeting for the respective milestone.
- Daily updates and progress will be discussed in the group chat to keep all members informed and engaged with ongoing tasks and responsibilities.
- Ensure the quality of work meets or exceeds the milestone goals or what is discussed during meetings.

## Task Distribution

- Evenly distribute each task among individuals may not always be evenly achivable. If one member contributes more to a specific task, other team members will take on larger portions of other tasks.
- Evenly divide code reviews among members who did not write the code for a particular piece or function.

## Decision Making Procedures

- Make important decisions during meetings and, if necessary, through voting.
